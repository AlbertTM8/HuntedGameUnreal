<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Steam Online Subsystem
The Steam Online Subsystem is a module that integrates Steamworks features into your game, enabling various online functionalities such as matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, and more. I've set it up to help players create game sessions within my game, invite their friends through the friends list, and add them to the current game session. Here's a video demo of the game demonstrated through a local connection:

## Random Maze Generator

I created this c++ class for randomly generating mazes, by randomly "walking" around in the world until it runs out of places to go. It also can generate rooms based on the blueprint data as shown in the video. The assets are from a maze generation blog that my code is built upon.
